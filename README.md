### Special considerations

If the plugin's required database tables don't automatically get created for whatever reason, you can create them manually using the sql.txt file included in the plugin folder. You can refer to our [Running a SQL Code on your WPMU Database](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wpmu-manual/running-a-sql-code-on-your-wpmu-database/) page from our online manuals for further assistance with that.

If a user unsubscribes from your mass emails, and then wishes to re-subscribe, go to Users > All Users in your network admin. Click the edit link for the user in question, then scroll down to the bottom of the screen and set "Receive admin emails" to "Yes".
